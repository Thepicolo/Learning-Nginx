# Learning Nginx

Welcome to my Nginx learning repository! This is a personal project where I document my journey of learning Nginx. I'll be using this repository to share my configurations, scripts, and notes as I explore different features and functionalities of Nginx.

I'll be also using docker compose to make this more portable.


## Introduction

Nginx is a versatile web server used for serving static content, reverse proxying, load balancing, and more. In this repository, I will cover various use cases and configurations as I learn how to effectively use Nginx in different scenarios.
